Hi my name is Jesús José Martha Laborin, I am from Juárez city which is located in the state of chihuahua, Mexico.

I have always been fascinated by technology in general, smartphones, computers, cars everything related to technology, I even installed different ROMs to my phones even when I didn't know what I was doing.  

I have an unfinished, systems and industrial engineer degree.

Right now, I am trying to learn how to be a web developer on my own with free courses mainly and a program called Next One Education by Oracle and Alura Latin, hopefully I will be able to be a self-taught software developer.

You can reach me on my linkedIn profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesus-jose-martha-laborin-a3a55015a/.
